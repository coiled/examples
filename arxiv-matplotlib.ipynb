These bytes persist in PDFs that contain Matplotlib plots, including the PDFs stored on arXiv.  As a result, it's pretty simple to check if a PDF contains a Matplotlib image.  All we have to do is scan through every PDF and look for these bytes; no parsing required.\n",

    "### Matplotlib + arXiv\n",
    "\n",
    "It's incredible to see the steady growth of Matplotlib across arXiv.  It's worth noting that this is *all* papers, even from fields like theoretical mathematics that are unlikely to include computer generated plots.  Is this matplotlib growing in popularity?  Is it Python generally?\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, we should break this down by subfield.  The filenames actually contained the name of the field for a while, like \"hep-ex\" for \"high energy physics, experimental\", but it looks like arXiv stopped doing this at some point.  My guess is that there is a list mapping filenames to fields somewhere though.  The filenames are all in the Pandas dataframe / parquet dataset, so doing this analysis shouldn't require any scalable computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coiled\n",
    "\n",
    "Coiled was built to make it easy to answer large questions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We started this notebook with some generic Python code. When we wanted to scale up we invoked Coiled, did some work, and then tore things down, all in about ten minutes. The problem of scale or \"big data\" didn't get in the way of us analyzing data and making a delightful discovery. \n",
